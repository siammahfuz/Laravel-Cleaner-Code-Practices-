🚀 Laravel: Cleaner Code Practices ✨

I believe clean code isn’t a luxury—it’s the foundation that lets us move fast without breaking things.

In my Laravel projects, I’ve found that a few habits go a long way in keeping the app easy to read, test, and scale:

🔹 Use Form Requests – Keep controllers slim by validating inputs in dedicated request classes.
🔹 Leverage Eloquent Scopes & Accessors – Encapsulate logic in your models for cleaner queries.
🔹 Follow SOLID Principles – Break down large classes and methods into focused, reusable components.
🔹 Use Repositories & Services – Separate database logic from business logic.
🔹 Consistent Naming – Readable, predictable naming saves hours of debugging.
🔹 Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) – Extract shared code into helpers, traits, or dedicated classes.

👉 For me, the goal isn’t just “less code” but clear, intentional code that scales with the project and the team.

💡 Curious to know: what’s your favorite tip for writing cleaner Laravel code?
